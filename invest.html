  <h1>What is Investing?</h1>
  <br>
    <h2>Investing is a way to set aside money while you are busy with life and have that money work for you so that you can fully reap the rewards of your labor in the future. Legendary investor Warren Buffett defines investing as "…the process of laying out money now to receive more money in the future." The goal of investing is to put your money to work in one or more types of investment vehicles in the hopes of growing your money over time.</h2>
  
  <br>
  <h2>Growing up,
most of us were taught that you can earn an income only by getting a job and
working. And that's exactly what most of us do. There's one big problem with this:
if you want more money, you have to work more hours. However, there is a limit
to how many hours a day we can work, not to mention the fact that having a
bunch of money is no fun if we don't have the leisure time to enjoy it.</h2></div>

				<h3>Bonds</h3>
        <hr>
				<p>When

        <p>
The main attraction of bonds is their relative safety</p>
<p>If you are buying bonds from
a stable government, your investment is virtually guaranteed, or risk-free</p>

<!-- The
safety and stability, however, come at a cost. Because there is little risk, there is
little potential return. As a result, the rate of return on bonds is generally lower
than other securities.  -->

				<h3>Index Funds</h3>
        <hr>
				<p>An index fund is a type of mutual fund that passively tracks an index, rather than paying a manager to pick and choose investments</p>
          
          <!--For example, an S&P 500 index fund will aim to mirror the performance of the S&P 500 by holding stock of the companies within that index. </p>-->
        <p>The benefit of index funds is that they tend to cost less because they don’t have that active manager on the payroll. The risk associated with an index fund will depend on the investments within the fund. </p>
